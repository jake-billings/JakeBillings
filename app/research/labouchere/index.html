                        The Labouchère gambling system is hypothesized to increase the probability of winning a
                        predetermined arbitrary profit in a gambling system such as a coin flip or a roulette game in
                        which both payouts and odds are 1:1. However, use of the system increases the downside monetary
                        risk in the event of a streak of multiple losses. To begin, a player creates an arbitrary series
                        of consecutive integers with a sum equal to the desired profit from multiple rounds of betting.
                        Using the system, a player will either win an amount equal to the sum of the elements of the
                        initial series or lose all of their available capital. This sequence was simulated multiple
                        times to determine the statistical characteristics of both the return and of the loss in an
                        average round of betting. By running the simulations of millions of rounds of Labouchere, it was
                        possible to discern the probable outcomes of running the system using the Labouche gambling
                        sequence and plotting the results on a graph to map the average return on the initial capital
                        investment. The Labouchère system is very psychologically appealing to players because when
                        applied over time it provides very consistent linear returns. However, there is eventually a
                        critical moment at which the available capital for betting is exceeded and a player loses all of
                        their available capital. It was found that as the number of bets increased, the outcome of
                        applying the sequence approached zero.
